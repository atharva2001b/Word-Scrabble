# Word-Scrabble
This is project which finds the match percent of the word horizontally and/or virtacally, in a given character pointer 2d Vector array. C++ concepts such as Pointers and Vectors are highlighted. It gives implementation of gid traversing in c++.

## Explaination
- First traverse horizontally through 2d Vector array of characters, find match percentage
- do the same thing horizontally

## Algorithm and Qn statement
- find it in the C++ file
